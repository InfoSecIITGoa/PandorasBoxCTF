# PandorasBoxCTF

Pandora’s Box is the Capture the Flag (CTF) competition in Cepheus'21, the official tech fest of IIT Goa. CTFs are a type of competitive hacking event in which the teams participating will get tasks or challenges related to different aspects of cybersecurity. Each challenge will have a goal, i.e. to find the hidden flag. Submission of flags gives varying points to the team according to the difficulty of the challenge. The team with more points within a shorter time will be the winner. Pandora’s Box CTF is going to be a Jeopardy-style CTF involving categories like Web, Cryptography, OSINT, Steganography, etc. The CTF is hosted by INFOSEC IIT Goa.
