"Many years ago , people got an idea of encrypting messages using some kind of logic gates. We intercepted a similar encrypted message. We even got the key using which the secret was encrypted. Don't ask your ANSI-STORS!

Ciphertext : 14,95,13,11,9,51,3,6,2,52,46,53
Key = “flag”

Let X is your decrypted message
Then, Submit the message PBCTF{X}"
